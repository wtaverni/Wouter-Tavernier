# Wouter Tavernier
## About me
I am an assistant professor at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be), Belgium, and [IMEC](https://www.imec-int.com/en), Belgium, and a member of the [IDLab research group](https://idlab.ugent.be/), where I lead the Fixed Internet Architectures and Optical Networks (FARON) team. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Ghent University, Belgium, in 2002, and B.Sc. in Philosophy from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 2003.  After a 2-year period at Accenture, I went back in 2006 to Ghent University studying Carrier Ethernet and alternative Internet routing technologies to obtain my PhD in Computer Science Engineering at the same university in 2012. 

Currently, my **research interests** are in deterministic networking (TSN), networking for high-performance computing, and network acceleration technologies. I am particularly interested in control-related topics requiring modelling, optimization of resources and associated performance, or the design of distributed protocols.
