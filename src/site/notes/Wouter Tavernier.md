# Wouter Tavernier
## About me
I am **assistent professor** at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be), Belgium, and [IMEC](https://www.imec-int.com/en), Belgium, and a member of the [IDLab research group](https://idlab.ugent.be/), where I lead the team Fixed Internet Architectures and Optical Networks (FARON) team. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/), Belgium, in 2002, and B.Sc. in Philosophy from [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](http://kuleuven.be).  After a 2-year period at [Accenture](http://www.accenture.com), I went back to [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/) studying Carrier Ethernet and alternative Internet routing technologies to obtain my PhD in Computer Science Engineering at the same university in 2012. 

Currently, my **research interests** are in deterministic networking (TSN), software-defined networking and network acceleration technologies. I am particularly interested in control-related topics requiring modelling, optimization of resources and associated performance, or the design of (distributed) protocols.
